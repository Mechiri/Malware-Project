# An Analysis of the Deployment of Exploit Mitigation Techniques in Operating Systems

This project will serve as a comprehensive analysis on the deployment of exploit
mitigation techniques on different compilers and various binaries in operating systems. The
paper first provides an overview of exploits and explains the exploit mitigation techniques
chosen for our analysis. The paper then focuses on mitigations used in different versions of
compilers and provides recommendations on which versions are ideal to use based on the
versions that are more secure. Following this, we move on to the core focus of this paper, which
is analyzing the mitigations implemented in the binaries of the Operating Systems, namely
Ubuntu 18.04.3 and Windows 10, which are the most recent versions of these operating
systems. We first explain the data collection methodology used to extract the binaries of the
operating systems and highlight the total number of binaries that do not have the appropriate
mitigations. This is followed by an in-depth evaluation of specific important binaries, programs
and applications that we have identified as critical that have not enabled mitigations. We then
compare the availability of mitigations present in Ubuntu 18.04.3 and Windows 10. Following
this we then conclude by discussing the results obtained from our analysis.
