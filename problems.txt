Bro,

To download debian buster package in my current folder(my os is ubuntu).

Problem1
--------
I copy pasted the below lines in /etc/apt/sources.list
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian buster main contrib non-free
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian buster main contrib non-free

when I run `sudo apt-get update` the following errors are occuring
Err:1 http://deb.debian.org/debian buster InRelease

I tried some solutions(below) but didn't resolved.
apt-cache policy debian-keyring
apt-cache policy debian-archive-keyring
gpg --export 04EE7237B7D453EC | apt-key add -

Problem2
--------
If debian repository successfully updated then I want to run below commands to download debain buster package in current folder.
Is the following commands correct?

apt-get source buster
